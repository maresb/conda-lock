"""Unit tests for ``conda_lock.solver.dry_run``.

Solver-output normalization concerns: rich-LINK to FETCH synthesis
(the mamba-family fast path), disk-fallback reconstruction for
sparse LINKs (conda, Python mamba 1.x), and the WARNING that
surfaces when the disk-fallback path is hit.

The dict literals model real mamba/conda JSON output, which is
dynamically typed at the boundary -- pretending they were TypedDicts
at every call site would be a wall of casts without catching real
bugs. The relevant arg-type checks are disabled file-wide.

# layer warn directly" mistake fails loudly instead of regressing
